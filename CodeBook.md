### Tidy data set description
The variables in the tidy data

Tidy data contains 180 rows and 82 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.
Only all the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set were kept.

    mean(): Mean value
    std(): Standard deviation

The data were averaged based on subject and activity group.

### Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below.

    1.WALKING
    2.WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    3.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    4.SITTING
    5.STANDING
    6.LAYING

### The tidy data contains 82 columns.
